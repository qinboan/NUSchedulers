# NUSchedulers

**Milestone 1**

Team: NUSchedulers

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11 

**Motivation**

Planning a timetable for the semester can be a tedious and time-consuming task for NUS students. Although NusMods provides a list of lectures and tutorial timings, it does not automatically generate a timetable for users. Students have to spend time coordinating with their friends and ensuring they choose the best classes. Our motivation is to develop a web application that simplifies the process of generating an ideal timetable based on the userâ€™s inputted modules and specifications.

**Aim**

We aim to provide NUS students with a user-friendly timetable web app that can automatically generate an ideal timetable based on inputted modules and user specifications. The app will allow users to personalize their timetable by adding custom events, provide reminders for upcoming classes and events, and allow users to set their own reminders for specific deadlines.

**User Stories**



1. As a student, I want to be able to plan my timetable easily.
2. As a student, I want to design an efficient timetable that best matches my ideal schedule.
3. As a student, I want to be able to attend classes with my friends.
4. As a student, I want to keep track of my events and deadlines clearly. 
5. As a student, I want to be able to see my schedule conveniently.

**Project Scope**

The web application helps to generate an ideal timetable for students and also helps to keep track of their schedules and deadlines.

The web application provides a timetable-like interface for students to input their modules and specifications and the timetable would be generated based on their modules taken. There is also an advanced filter function for users to set conditions for generating their timetable. Users can personalise their timetable by adding custom events, such as group meetings, study sessions or work shifts. The app provides reminders for upcoming classes and events and allows users to set their own reminders for specific deadlines.

Features to be completed by the mid of June: 



1. User authentication and module input
2. Basic and advanced filter timetable generation
    1. Conditions can include but are not limited to:
        1. How many days the user wants to go to school
        2. No morning/night classes
        3. A one-hour lunch break from 12 pm-2 pm
        4. The timetable must include the particular lesson that the user chose

Features to be completed by the mid of July: 



1. Allow users to personalise their timetable by adding their own custom events
2. Reminders for upcoming classes and events
3. User can also set their own reminders for their own upcoming events and deadlines
