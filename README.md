<strong>Motivation </strong>
</p>
<p>
Planning a timetable for the semester can be a tedious and time-consuming task for NUS students. Although NusMods provides a list of lectures and tutorial timings, it does not automatically generate a timetable for users. Students have to spend time coordinating with their friends and ensuring they choose the best classes. Our motivation is to develop a web application that simplifies the process of generating an ideal timetable based on the user’s inputted modules and specifications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aim </strong>
</p>
<p>
We aim to provide NUS students with a user-friendly timetable web app that can automatically generate an ideal timetable based on inputted modules and user specifications. The app will allow users to personalize their timetable by adding custom events, provide reminders for upcoming classes and events, and allow users to set their own reminders for specific deadlines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>User Stories</strong>
</p>
<ol>

<li>As a student, I want to be able to plan my timetable easily.

<li>As a student, I want to design an efficient timetable that best matches my ideal schedule.

<li>As a student, I want to be able to attend classes with my friends.

<li>As a student, I want to keep track of my events and deadlines clearly. 

<li>As a student, I want to be able to see my schedule conveniently.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Project Scope</strong>
</p>
<p>
The web application helps to generate an ideal timetable for students and also helps to keep track of their schedules and deadlines.
</p>
<p>
The web application provides a timetable-like interface for students to input their modules and specifications and the timetable would be generated based on their modules taken. There is also an advanced filter function for users to set conditions for generating their timetable. Users can personalise their timetable by adding custom events, such as group meetings, study sessions or work shifts. The app provides reminders for upcoming classes and events and allows users to set their own reminders for specific deadlines.

<strong>Timetable Generation Algorithm</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Basic (No filters)</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Classes with the least slots are prioritized, and chosen first.

<li>If there are definite clashes among the modules chosen, the timetable will not be generated and an alert indicating that there are timetable clashes will be shown.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Advanced filters</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Check for the criteria (exclude days, start, end time) 
<ul>
 
<li>If it does not fulfill the criteria, then it will continue checking for other classes
 
<li>If the class selected fulfils the criteria and does not overlap with other selected classes, then it will be immediately chosen
 
<li>If all classes that does not overlap does not fulfil the criteria, a random class that does not overlap will be chosen and an alert indicating that the timetable does not fulfil the criteria will be shown
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>

<strong>Challenges</strong>
</p>
<p>
Creating a timetable generator requires collecting various types of information such as class schedules, users’ preferences, etc. We faced a lot of difficulties in trying to successfully pass the correct information around to ensure that the timetable generator works reliably and accurately. Furthermore, we had to take into account scheduling conflicts, users’ preferences such as which days to be excluded, and the preferred start and end class timing for the users. Integrating all this information into a coherent system posed a significant challenge for us.
</p>
<p>
During the development process, we encountered some difficulties in deploying our website due to the separation of the frontend and backend components. The frontend and backend servers had to be started separately for the website to run, and this made it more complicated to deploy the website.
